<p>If you installed the newest MongoDB&nbsp;version 6, the <code>mongo</code> command (that you will learn about in the next lecture) <strong>is no longer included there</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, when using MongoDB version 6, instead of using the <code>mongo</code> command you need need to use the new <code>mongosh</code> command to start the <strong>MongoDB Shell</strong> while following the course. Its interface might look only slightly different, but you can continue to follow the course lectures without any issues using <code>mongosh</code>.</p><ul><li><p>Note:&nbsp;If the <code>mongo</code> command is working for you, it likely means that you are using a version that still supported it, so you can continue with the course using the <code>mongo</code> command.</p></li><li><p>Another note: If you are using Windows and you get an error that the <code>mongosh</code> command is not defined on your system, you might need to install MongoDB&nbsp;Shell (mongosh) separately. If that happens, then please refer to the MongoDB&nbsp;Shell instructions from the previous lecture about installing MongoDB on Windows.</p></li></ul><p><br></p>
