<h4>Important note regarding the upcoming video lecture!</h4><p><strong>Be sure to fully watch the next video lecture to find out and understand which code we are referring to in this note.</strong></p><p>The potential error that you might get with the newest mongoose version 7 while writing the code in the next video: <code>TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `false` is not a valid type at path `id`.</code></p><p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p><p>In that next video lecture, toward the last part of the video, in the models/user.js code, we will be implementing the following line of code in the <code>addresses</code> array inside of a mongoose schema named <code>userSchema</code>:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">      _id: {id: false},</pre><p>If adding this line makes your app show the error message mentioned above, you might be using the newest mongoose 7 module versions.</p><p>To solve it, modify the mentioned line by adding an underscore <code>_</code> before the <code>id</code> in the <code>{ _id: false }</code> syntax on that line. So, that line should now look like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">      _id: {_id: false},</pre><p>That should solve any mongoose version 7 errors related to it.</p><p><strong>ANOTHER&nbsp;SOLUTION:</strong></p><p>To avoid compatibility issues with this and to be able to use Colt's exact code from the upcoming video lecture, you can install a mongoose version lower than 7.0.0 by using the following npm command, and then that error shouldn't happen:</p><p><code>npm install mongoose@"&lt;7.0.0"</code></p><p><em>(be sure to type or copy-paste this command exactly as shown above)</em></p><p>If you need more help with any of this, please reach out to the Q&amp;A boards!</p>
