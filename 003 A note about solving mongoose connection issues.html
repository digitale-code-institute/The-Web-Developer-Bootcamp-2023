<h4>Solving mongoose.connect issues</h4><p>If you are using the latest versions of Node.js with mongoose, and you get a connection refused <code>ECONNREFUSED</code> error message when connecting your app to the database, then you might need to change <code>localhost</code> to <code>127.0.0.1</code> in your <strong>mongoose.connect</strong> database connection string:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name_here')</pre><p>Also, in the currently newest mongoose versions you <strong>don't</strong> need to pass the options object as the second argument to the mongoose.connect method.</p><p>Therefore, when using the newest mongoose versions, your mongoose.connect call can look just like shown above, <strong>without</strong> adding an object with options such as useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology, useCreateIndex, or useFindAndModify.</p><h4>strictQuery warning message</h4><p>You might see this warning message with the newest mongoose versions when starting your app:</p><blockquote><p>DeprecationWarning: Mongoose: the `strictQuery` option will be switched back to `false` by default in Mongoose 7. Use `mongoose.set('strictQuery', false);` if you want to prepare for this change. Or use `mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);` to suppress this warning.</p></blockquote><p>That warning message itself shouldn't affect the functionality of our course apps, but you could make it disappear by adding the mentioned <code>mongoose.set('strictQuery', true);</code> line <strong>above</strong> the mongoose.connect line in your code.</p><p>Moving forward, keep a note of all this and make sure to use the solutions presented in this lecture note whenever you encounter the described issues in any of the future course lectures.</p><p>Also, please reach out in the course Q&amp;A boards if you need any further help!</p>
