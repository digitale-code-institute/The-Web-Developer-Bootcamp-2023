<h4>For Windows Machines Only!</h4><p>If you are on a Windows machine, please follow the instructions linked below (in the resources) to install the Git Bash terminal on your machine, so you have a terminal that works more similarly to Colt's Mac terminal. Note:&nbsp;the Git installation steps shown in the tutorial might be updated and look somewhat different in newer Git installer versions  so, if there are some different options that show up compared to what you see in the tutorial, you can just choose the default (pre-selected) options in the installer and continue with the installation process.</p><p>Mac users, your computer already has a Unix shell.&nbsp; Re-watch the previous video for specific details.</p>
