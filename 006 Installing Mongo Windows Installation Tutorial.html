<p>Setting up MongoDB on Windows will consist of completing these two installations:</p><ol><li><p><strong>MongoDB&nbsp;Community Server</strong> Installation</p></li><li><p><strong>MongoDB&nbsp;Shell</strong> Installation</p></li></ol><h4><strong>MongoDB&nbsp;Community Server Installation</strong></h4><p><strong>1.</strong> Visit this page to download the MongoDB Community Server edition: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> Scroll down the page and make sure these options are picked from the download page:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Version</strong>: 6.x.x or 7.x.x  Note: keep in mind that the current Version might be different at the time when you are following this tutorial. Just be sure that you pick any edition of <strong>MongoDB version 6 or 7</strong> thats marked as <strong>(current)</strong> in the menu.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform</strong>: Windows</p></li><li><p><strong>Package</strong>: msi</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-45-59-931d326ea7c338687c5850de088654d3.png"></figure><p>Click the green <strong>Download</strong> button and it should download the MongoDB Windows installation file with the <strong>.msi</strong> extension to your computer.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After the download finishes, run the MongoDB <strong>.msi</strong> installation file.</p><p><em>* Note: If the Window security dialog pops up when you run the installation file, press any of these options (depending on whats shown in your interface): Yes or Allow or Run.</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong> After it prepares the installation, you should see this screen, where you would press <strong>Next</strong>:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-53-07-321e0ed7fcab49e1c07c8734a6d379d6.png"></figure><p><strong>5.</strong> Tick the I accept the terms in the License Agreement checkbox (after reading the license agreement carefully).

Make sure that <strong>Install MongoD as a Service</strong> is selected so the MongoDB database server automatically runs in the background, and also choose the Run service as Network Service user option. You can leave the default values for the Service Name, Data Directory, and Log Directory fields.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-53-07-b15e1eb6ac24fc2832fb723b70dce7dd.png"></figure><p><strong>8.</strong> On the next screen, you can leave the Install MongoDB Compass option ticked and click <strong>Next</strong> again.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-53-07-0e412a4ffaf879f6ce9f1ab64a690b7b.png"></figure><p><strong>9.</strong> Then, click the <strong>Install</strong> button to start the MongoDB installation process! </p><p><em>* Note: If the Window security dialog pops up when the installation starts, press any of these options (depending on whats shown in your interface): Yes or Allow or Run.</em></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-53-07-26cca9992e111c928823da39bcbba897.png"></figure><p><strong>10.</strong> Wait until the installation process fully finishes. After that, you will be taken to the final installation screen where you can click the <strong>Finish</strong> button:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_17-53-07-c36be4ed2752b6b4339195c0d43e917f.png"></figure><p><strong>11.</strong> Now, we can move on to the <strong>MongoDB Shell</strong> installation.</p><h4><strong>MongoDB Shell Installation</strong></h4><p>Since MongoDB version 6, the <code>mongo</code> terminal command is no longer included as a way to start the MongoDB shell (you will learn about this in the upcoming lecture video named "The Mongo&nbsp;Shell"). We now actually have to install MongoDB Shell separately. After we install the <strong>MongoDB Shell</strong> using the instructions below, we get the <code>mongosh</code> terminal command which we should be using <strong>instead</strong> of the <code>mongo</code> command while following the course. <strong>So, whenever you see Colt type the </strong><code><strong>mongo</strong></code><strong> command in the terminal in any of the upcoming course videos, you should type the </strong><code><strong>mongosh</strong></code><strong> command instead.</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Visit the MongoDB official download page for MongoDB Shell (mongosh) here: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> Scroll down the page and make sure these options are picked from the MongoDB Shell download page:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Version</strong>: You can choose whatever the latest offered version of the MongoDB Shell is, but make sure it's compatible with your version of Windows.<br>- You can choose the newest MongoDB&nbsp;Shell version 2.* if you are running Windows 10 or newer (this is recommended if your version of Windows is compatible with it).<br>- You can choose the latest MongoDB&nbsp;Shell version 1.* if you are running Windows 8.1 or newer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform</strong>: <br>- If you chose MongoDB&nbsp;Shell version 2.* in the previous step, then choose the <strong>Windows x64 (10+)</strong> option for the platform here.<br>- If you chose MongoDB&nbsp;Shell version 1.* in the previous step, then dont choose the default value for the Platform option offered. Instead, you need to click on the Platform menu, and then <strong>scroll down the menu</strong> until you find the Windows <code><strong>MSI</strong></code> option. You should choose this exact option for the Platform (dont choose any other option): <strong>Windows 64-bit (8.1+) (MSI)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Package</strong>: <code>IMPORTANT</code> make sure that this option is selected: <code><strong>msi</strong></code></p></li></ul><p>Then, click the green <strong>Download</strong> button and it should download the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) Windows installation file with the <strong>.msi</strong> extension to your computer.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After the download finishes, run the MongoDB <strong>.msi</strong> installation file.</p><p><em>* Note: If the Window security dialog pops up when you run the installation file, press any of these options (depending on whats shown in your interface): Yes or Allow or Run.</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong> After it prepares the installation, you should see this screen, where you would press <strong>Next</strong>:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_18-04-31-a1ca996d9dff70e5f9ddf5cf9fdce77b.png"></figure><p><strong>5.</strong> You can leave the following installation settings as default (unless you have a specific preference to change these settings) and click <strong>Next</strong> again:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_18-04-31-468faf3cae42e3d5e02629bd05b5b12a.png"></figure><p><strong>6.</strong> Click the <strong>Install</strong> button to start the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) installation process:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_18-04-31-7943b813717861eb1156758a52f25421.png"></figure><p><strong>7.</strong> When the installation process is finished, click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to finalize the installation wizard:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-05-31_18-04-31-5e0f3c06b90cabc8aaec7e4f57609aac.png"></figure><p>And thats it! You should now have the MongoDB Shell installed. When you open your terminal again (note: if you already had a terminal window open, make sure to restart it), you should be able to use the <code>mongosh</code> command to start the MongoDB Shell. As mentioned above, <strong>while going forward with the course, instead of using the </strong><code><strong>mongo</strong></code><strong> command (which was used in the previous versions of MongoDB), now use the </strong><code><strong>mongosh</strong></code><strong> command instead.</strong></p><p>Also, a note: You might see that the MonogDB Shell that you start with the <code>mongosh</code> command has some slight visual differences compared to the <code>mongo</code> shell that you will see Colt using in the lecture videos, but you can ignore that since it will work correctly when you follow the lectures with this new MongoDB shell.</p><p>If you need any help with this MongoDB installation tutorial for Windows, please reach out on the Q&amp;A boards.</p>
